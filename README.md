# Register-file-and-Decoder
Register file: 
VHDL model for single-cycle datapath register file.
RV32 register file consists of 32, 32-bit registers.Modeled in vhdl as two dimensional array

Instruction Decoder:
VHDL model for a RV32I intsruction decoder.The decoder takes an RV32I instruction
as input and generates the control signals needed to execute the instruction in the single-cycle
datapath as output.
